### Airbnb in New York

# Exploratory data analysis in Python 

- Downloaded New York Airbnb data from Kaggle.com.
- Performed a complete EDA, including all steps of the process.
- Wrote down the conclusions of each step and analyze the results based on the relationships between the variables.

A company has collected New York housing rental data from the Airbnb app during 2019. This dataset was used to train Machine Learning models during that year, in an open competition.

I used it to perfomed a completa EDA about the variables that make up the dataset in order to understand it and draw conclusions about it.
